# Resources made by the Coders Who Teach community

This folder is for resources we've made and want to host ourselves here. 

The [resources page](https://coderswhoteach.com/resources) lists resources from all over the web. Some of them are made by us, or have been provided by speakers at the meetup and so reside in this folder.

We'd love contributions to folder or the resources list - check out the [README for the whole website repository](https://github.com/coderswhoteach/coderswhoteach.github.io).
