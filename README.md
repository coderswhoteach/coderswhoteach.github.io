# Coders Who Teach

Repository for the coderswhoteach.com website. Coders Who Teach is a community for sharing experience and best practice in teaching programming outside of the school classroom; whether at volunteer meetups, bootcamps or coding courses.

## About the site

This site was built very quickly in HTML and CSS, with a line of JS for the mobile menu. If we need something fancier later down the line, we'll build it then. It is hosted on GitHub pages, so the `master` branch of this repository is the production source code.
